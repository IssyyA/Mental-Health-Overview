# Project Overview
This project explores global mental health trends from 1990 to 2019 using a dataset that captures the prevalence of various mental health disorders across countries and continents.
The dashboard visualizes disorder prevalence, tracks year-over-year trends, and highlights regional differences. Its goal is to provide stakeholders, such as global health researchers or policy analysts, with a high-level overview of how mental health has evolved worldwide. As a data analyst working on this project, the objective was to extract insights into disorder prevalence, global patterns, and changes over time 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* Category 1: Country-Level Prevalence Trends
* Category 2: Disorder-Type Analysis (Anxiety, Depression, etc.)
* Category 3: Year-over-Year Global Trends
* Category 4: Regional Comparisons by Continent
*

# Dataset Description
The main database structure, as seen below, consists of one table: table1, with a total row count of 30,600 records. A description of the table is as follows:
* Countries
* Continent
* Year
* Disorder
* Share of population
# Key Visualizations

Top 5 Countries with the highest mental health prevalence

Disorder Impact Map showing global distribution

Yearly Mental Health Trend showing changes over time

Disorder Breakdown showing proportions of anxiety, depression, etc.

Filters by year, continent, and disorder type for interactive exploration

# Insights
1. Highest Prevalence Countries
Portugal, New Zealand, and Palestine recorded the highest mental health prevalence (~2.6â€“2.8%).

2. Disorder Type Trends
Anxiety and Depression are the most prevalent disorders globally, making up the largest share of mental health issues.

3. Global Trends Over Time
Mental health prevalence increased from 1990 to 2019, with cyclical rises and dips in the early 2000s.

# Recommendations
Policy Prioritization: Countries with high prevalence should allocate more resources to mental health programs.

Awareness Campaigns: Emphasis on anxiety and depression could help target the most affected groups.

Further Analysis: Country-level healthcare policies and funding data could be merged to understand root causes.
# Tools Used
Power Query: Data cleaning
Power BI: Dashboard creation

Power BI/Excel Dashboards: For visuals and interactivity


# Assumptions
* Missing data for some countries/years was excluded.
* Disorders were grouped into five broad categories: Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Eating Disorders.
