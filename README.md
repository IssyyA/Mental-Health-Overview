# Project Overview
This project explores global mental health trends from 1990 to 2019 using a dataset that captures the prevalence of various mental health disorders across countries and continents.
The dashboard visualizes disorder prevalence, tracks year-over-year trends, and highlights regional differences. Its goal is to provide stakeholders, such as global health researchers or policy analysts, with a high-level overview of how mental health has evolved worldwide. As a data analyst working on this project, the objective was to extract insights into disorder prevalence, global patterns, and changes over time 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* Category 1: Country-Level Prevalence Trends
* Category 2: Disorder-Type Analysis (Anxiety, Depression, etc.)
* Category 3: Year-over-Year Global Trends
* Category 4: Regional Comparisons by Continent
*

# Dataset Description
The main database structure, as seen below, consists of one table: table1, with a total row count of 30,600 records. A description of the table is as follows:
* Countries
* Continent
* Year
* Disorder
* Share of population
# Executive Summary 
## Overview of Findings
Between 1990 and 2019, mental health disorders increased slightly on a global scale, with anxiety and depression being the most common across all regions. Certain countries consistently recorded higher-than-average prevalence, suggesting possible policy, social, or healthcare access gaps.
*Anxiety and depression make up over 70% of reported cases globally.
*Countries like Portugal and New Zealand show persistently high prevalence, suggesting national-level mental health strain.
*The mental health burden has been rising slowly but steadily, with regional disparities pointing to localized causes.

# Insights Deep dive 
*Category 1: Country-Level Prevalence
**Portugal consistently had one of the highest prevalence rates (~2.8%), particularly in the early 2000s, suggesting national factors such as stress, economic hardship, or healthcare access might contribute.
**New Zealand remained in the top 5 most affected countries across multiple years, with mental health prevalence averaging over 2.6% — highlighting strong awareness/reporting or potential societal stressors.
**Palestine and Australia also showed elevated levels. In Palestine’s case, conflict-related trauma may be a major contributing factor.
**Many African and South Asian nations show lower prevalence, which may reflect underreporting or cultural stigma, rather than genuinely lower rates.

# Insights
1. Highest Prevalence Countries
Portugal, New Zealand, and Palestine recorded the highest mental health prevalence (~2.6–2.8%).

2. Disorder Type Trends
Anxiety and Depression are the most prevalent disorders globally, making up the largest share of mental health issues.

3. Global Trends Over Time
Mental health prevalence increased from 1990 to 2019, with cyclical rises and dips in the early 2000s.

# Recommendations
Policy Prioritization: Countries with high prevalence should allocate more resources to mental health programs.

Awareness Campaigns: Emphasis on anxiety and depression could help target the most affected groups.

Further Analysis: Country-level healthcare policies and funding data could be merged to understand root causes.
# Tools Used
Power Query: Data cleaning
Power BI: Dashboard creation

Power BI/Excel Dashboards: For visuals and interactivity


# Assumptions
* Missing data for some countries/years was excluded.
* Disorders were grouped into five broad categories: Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Eating Disorders.
