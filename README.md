Exploratory analysis of mental health trends from 1990–2019 using Power BI
📊 Project Overview
This project explores global mental health trends from 1990 to 2019 using a dataset that captures the prevalence of various mental health disorders across countries and continents.

The dashboard visualizes disorder prevalence, tracks year-over-year trends, and highlights regional differences. The goal is to provide stakeholders—such as global health researchers or policy analysts—with a high-level overview of how mental health has evolved worldwide.
